    <h1>My name is Giancarlos Prieto.</h1>
    <p>I am a Junior year majoring in Business Anayltics and Information Systems. My career goal  is to graduate and find a remote job in my area of study. I want a remote job because I want to travel the world while I work. I would like to hopefully work for a successeful startup. Maybe create a startup with my friends.</p>
